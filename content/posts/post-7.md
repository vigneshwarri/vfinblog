 It is a common question that arises to all those who hear it newly or those who have the inspiration to learn it. Generally, we never separate the word "Accountancy" from our routine life. Really directly or indirectly we are using accounts many times, if you are going to join as a student in a university/ schools. You are supposed to pay a fee to your school or university here your University/ school makes a "collection" of your fees amount either through online payment or cash payment..then your University/ school make use of*"records"* their collections made from you. After that, they will make a sheet by "classifying" the amount of your fees as those who pay through the bank or through online banking as *"bank account"* and those who paid through cash as "Cash account". And then finally your University/ school make a Final sheet which is prepared to*"present"* the actual fees amount received and not yet received from you to the organizers of your university or schools...Hence we use accountancy in our regular day-to-day life.
